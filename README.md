# learning_plots_katrinia
In this lesson, we’ll focus on the fundamentals: learning what kinds of plots are available, when to use them, and how to make them using Python. For this exercise, we'll be working with Spotify Global Streaming Data (2024).

To begin:

Install the required libraries (if you haven’t already) by running in your terminal:

pip install matplotlib seaborn
Create a new project folder on your computer and name it something like:

learning_plots_yourname
For example: learning_plots_aileneJohnston
Inside that folder, create three subfolders:

data – this is where the csv file lives
plots - this is where we will save the plot images
notebooks – this is where your .ipynb file will go
Download the dataset from Kaggle:

CLICK HERE
Download the zip file, and extract it into the data folder you just created.
For the project, you will be using the file called: "Cleaned_Spotify_2024_Global_Streaming_Data.csv"
Open a Jupyter notebook inside the notebooks folder.

You’ll use this to follow along with the exercises and experiments in this lesson.
Initialize a Git repo in your project folder (learning_plots_yourname).

Run git init in the project folder
Make your first commit after the folder structure is created
Continue making commits after each major step or plot you build
Sync to GitHub now or later; you'll submit the repo link at the end of this lesson
Following these steps closely will give you practice not only with plotting, but also with managing a clean, reproducible workflow-something that matters in real-world data projects.
